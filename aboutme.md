title: About me
---

Hello, nice to meet you! I'm currently in my 3B term of Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo. 

I generally enjoy working on side projects with a high degree of architectural and theoretical complexity, such as my WIP Native x64 C++ Debugger or Custom Interpreter.

I am a team member doing embedded and FPGA programming with my design team at [UW Reality Labs](https://uwrealitylabs.com), where we are working with low-power implementation with Efinix Trion FPGAs to create robust VR headset. 

If you're looking to connect to talk about experiences, education, connect about an opportunity, or just hangout, feel free to send me an email or connect on linkedin!
